## Building secure computers operating system

For secure computers to succeed, we need to rethink how we operate with them. Right now we expect users to create a wallet, secure a seed phrase, understand transactions, tokens, fees, learn how DeFi protocols operate, and figure our the right dApp to use them. While this is the state of the art, and the dApps and protocols are absolutely incredible, the reality is that very few people care enough to go through all these complex steps. The success of DeFi, NFTs and gaming on blockchains is a great indicator of the potential of the technology. But we're still expecting tech-savvy users, either with a background in fintech or gaming.

Our view is that blockchains, and secure computers, lack operating systems. If I want to write some text on a computer, I'm not going to carefully craft instructions that will be sent to my CPU to read my keystrokes and store them on my hard-disk. Instead, an abstraction layer exist between the user and the application. Similarly, the way we interact with blockchains today is very low level. We make transactions to call smart contracts and move tokens. This reminds me of typing an executable file name in DOS and then manually naming a document to save it to the A:\ drive.

Our goal is to make it easier to interact with blockchains. We let you use secure computers, give them inputs, receive outputs. Our products sits between the decentralized applications and the user. Already, we introduce a few innovations to make this easier. Our custody solution lets you create wallets without dealing with private keys or seed phrases.

## To enable the next 100 million users

[Atato custody](https://www.atato.com/atato-custody/) is a modern digital assets custody platform where businesses can securely store and manage their cryptocurrencies using a web application, mobile application and APIs. We want to help businesses save time and money by creating a simple but yet powerful service for them to make deposits, withdrawals and use dApps.

Using multi-party computation, we abstract the concept of private keys, and enable new wallet recovery scenarios. This allows businesses such as digital asset service providers, exchanges, brokers, and other financial institutions to onboard a large number of users, securely and at a low cost. Small businesses also use our solutions to secure their crypto holdings.

Making blockchain transactions is how we interact with blockchains today, and our goal is to provide a simple, yet secure interface to use secure computers. Signing a transaction does not have to be a complex operation, and must be as easy as saving a file. As the vast majority of decentralized applications today are based on tokens, ERC20 and ERC721, these are the key features of our custody solution today. As the types of decentralized applications continues to evolve, our goal is to ensure that businesses have a secure access to them.
